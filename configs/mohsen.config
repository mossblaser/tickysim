		#                          boards. Each node has six links and links at the
		#                          outer edges of the network wrap-around. This
		#                          topology is the one intended for large real-world
		#                          SpiNNaker systems. In this type of system, chips
		#                          are arranged on hexagonal boards of radius
		#                          multi_board_torus_radius. Links within the board
		#                          are defined by the node_to_node_links paramters.
		#                          Links between boards are defined by the
		#                          board_to_board_links parameters. The size of the
		#                          network is specified (in three-board sets) by the
		#                          multi_board_torus_width/multi_board_torus_height

		#              simplified SpiNNaker systems. The size of the network is
		#              specified by the torus_width/torus_height parameters.
		#   "mesh" -- A "rectangular" hexagonal mesh network where each node (except
		#             those on the edges) has six links. Links at the edge of the
		#             mesh do not wrap around. The width and height can be specified
		#             by the mesh_width/mesh_height parameters.
		#   "board_mesh" -- A "hexagonal" hexagonal mesh network where each node
		#                   (except those on the edges) has six links. The nodes are
		#                   arranged in a hexagon as in the SpiNNaker boards. This
		#                   topology is the one used by single board SpiNNaker
